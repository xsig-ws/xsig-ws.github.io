It solicits contributions from a wide range of fields related to computing systems, infrastructures, and programming, spanning all areas covered by the sponsoring special interest groups.<\/p>\n<p>The main objectives of xSIG are to provide a forum to present and discuss research ideas among researchers spanning many fields and to raise young researchers through a globally standard peer review process. In particular,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we hope authors of xSIG workshop to advance their research based on feedback received and step up to submitting their work to international conferences and journals.<\/li>\n<li>we hope to give authors substantial feedback as well as a place for young researchers to practice\/improve writing papers for review, through the globally standard conference format of submitting papers for review, receiving\/writing reviews, discussing papers in the program committee meeting, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To this end, xSIG features the following key ideas.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>We do not publish workshop proceedings<\/em>, so that the work presented in xSIG will not be regarded as published; papers presented in xSIG will be available to the audience during the workshop.<\/li>\n<li><em>We particularly encourage students working on their Master\/Bachelor&#8217;s theses to submit a paper around them<\/em>. We award many students from diverse criteria.<\/li>\n<li>We establish <em>Young Program Committee Member<\/em> alongside the regular Program Committee and welcomes participation of young researchers including students to it, for \u201can early exposure\u201d of motivated students to peer review work normally done by senior researchers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>about xSIG xSIG (cross-disciplinary workshop on computing Systems, Infrastructures, and programminG) is a work <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/about.html\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"spay_email":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=20"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1476,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20\/revisions\/1476"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2020\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=20"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

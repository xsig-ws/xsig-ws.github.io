# Call for Posters

xSIG 2025 solicits poster presentations from a wide range (cross-SIG) fields of all sponsors and co-sponsors of xSIG.

- research of any stage, such as concept and problem presentation
- research presented at xSIG 2025 and SWoPP 2025 with an oral presentation.
- previously published research in other opportunities.
- introduction of research and development project.

We are planning to give poster awards for outstanding poster presentations to students.
(Please note that authors already awarded for oral presentation papers of xSIG 2025 are ineligible for the poster awards)
We hope various researchers, not limited to students and young researchers, have presentations here.
xSIG 2025 encourages authors of oral presentations of xSIG 2025 and SWoPP 2025 to introduce their research again in the poster session for in-depth discussions.

If the number of submissions exceeds the available capacity, we might decline some posters of oral presentation papers at xSIG and SWoPP in order to provide presentation opportunities for more people.
Also, we might decline out-of-scope posters from the xSIG interests.

The poster session will be provided only on-site at the xSIG/SWoPP venue.

Submission
--------------------

You have to enter the author information, title, and abstract of your poster. The abstract should be around 200-400 characters (in Japanese) or 100-200 words (in English). The title and author(s) will be listed on the xSIG website.

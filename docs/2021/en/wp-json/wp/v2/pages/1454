We welcome not only papers with original proposals or ideas but also papers reporting the results of practical research and development. All submitted papers will be reviewed by the <a href=\"\/2021\/en\/org\/oc-pc#pc\">Program Committee<\/a> (PC) to select accepted papers and awards. Moreover, <em>we purpose the progression of the researches and fostering young researchers through the reviewing process<\/em>. We expect the reviewers to give not only the evaluation of the paper but also constructive comment to advance the research. We expect the author(s) to advance the research, and submit revised papers to international conferences\/journals in the near future. To this end, we evaluate submitted papers from the view point not only of the quality of the paper but also of <em>the potential of the research<\/em>. The presentation quality is taken into account for the evaluation. Please visit <a href=\"dup\/\">this page<\/a> for the rules for duplicate submission.<\/p>\n<h3>Submission Regulations<\/h3>\n<p>Papers must be written in English or <a href=\"\/2021\/cf\/cfp\/\">Japanese<\/a>. The restriction on the submitted paper is relaxed utilizing the feature that xSIG does not publish proceedings. <em>The paper format is not restricted<\/em>. Not the number of pages but the number of words is limited. This would be 5 to 10 pages in 10pt, two-column style. Please read <a href=\"format\/\">this page<\/a> for more details. We use EasyChair for the process of submission and review. Here is <a href=\"https:\/\/easychair.org\/conferences\/?conf=xsig2021\">the submission page for xSIG 2021<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Awards<\/h3>\n<h4>Award Categories<\/h4>\n<dl>\n<dt>Research Awards<\/dt>\n<dd>We select one <em>Best Research Award<\/em>, and up to two <em>Outstanding Research Awards<\/em>.<\/dd>\n<dt>IEEE Computer Society Japan Chapter xSIG Young Researcher Award<\/dt>\n<dd>We also selects one or a few <em>IEEE Computer Society Japan Chapter xSIG Young Researcher Award<\/em> from the papers of which the first authors are aged 40 and below.<\/dd>\n<dt>Student Awards<\/dt>\n<dd>We also selects one <em>Best { Undergraduate | Master&#8217;s } Student Award<\/em>\uff0cand up to two <em>Outstanding { Undergraduate | Master&#8217;s } Student Awards<\/em> from the papers of which the first authors are { undergraduate | master&#8217;s course } students.<\/dd>\n<dt>Student Awards for Criteria<\/dt>\n<dd>We select <em>Outstanding { Effort | Presentation | English } Awards<\/em> from the papers of which the first authors are students at master&#8217;s course or below.

We do not give these awards to the core members, i.e., <a href=\"\/2021\/en\/org\/oc-pc\/\">the organizing chair, the program chair, and the program vice chairs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Young PC members<\/h3>\n<p>It is beneficial for young researchers to have experience of a PC member for their research and writing activity. We invite young researchers including students as <a href=\"\/2021\/en\/org\/young-pc\/\">Young PC members<\/a>. A student who have had his\/her submitted papers reviewed can be a young PC member. A submitted paper is assigned at most one young PC member along with regular PC members. A young PC member reviews the assigned paper, and participates in the discussion at the PC meeting. The regular PC members assigned to the paper and the PC are responsible for the final decision of paper acceptance.<\/p>\n<h3>IPSJ Transactions on ACS: Special Issue on xSIG<\/h3>\n<p>We will have a special issue on xSIG in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acs.hpcc.jp\/welcome-e.html\">IPSJ transactions of Advanced Computing Systems (ACS)<\/a>. The PC of xSIG cooperates with ACS editors for <em>quicker and more consistent review<\/em>. However, please note that submitted papers to ACS will be reviewed according to the criterion of ACS transactions which is not identical to that of xSIG.<\/p>\n<h3>No poster session in xSIG 2021<\/h3>\n<p>Due to the change in the conference style, xSIG 2021 will not have a poster session which the previous xSIG occurrences had.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scope and Review Criteria xSIG solicits contributions from a wide range of fields related to computing systems <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/cf\/cfp.html\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":17,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"spay_email":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1454"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1454"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1454\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1546,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1454\/revisions\/1546"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/17"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2021\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1454"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

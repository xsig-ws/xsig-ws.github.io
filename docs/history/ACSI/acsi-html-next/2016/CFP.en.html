<h4> [Overview] </h4>

<!-- included from include/aboutacsi-en.html Start -->
<p>
ACSI (Annual Meeting on Advanced Computing System and Infrastructure)
gives researchers in Japan an opportunity to present their work on a wide
variety of topics about advanced computing systems, practical
infrastructures, and technologies for enabling them. The first ACSI
meeting was held in January 2015 as a successor to the JSPP and SACSIS
symposium series. By discussing recent advances, future directions, and
practical experiences of these systems and technologies from wide and
various viewpoints, ACSI promotes sharing of research experiences in Japan
and the development of technologies. In addition, ACSI gives researchers
an opportunity to get feedback from the reviewers and attendees with
various backgrounds, and encourages submissions of revised versions of the
work to international conferences or refereed journals. For this purpose,
accepted papers are distributed only to attendees and not opened to the
public. The encouragement aims to promote international activities in the
relevant domestic research community.
</p>

<h4>[Topics and Submission Styles]</h4>

<!-- included from include/aboutacsi2-en.html Start -->
<p>
ACSI2016 invites papers on all topics about advanced computing
systems, practical infrastructures, and technologies for enabling them
including, but not limited to, the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Algorithm</li>
<li>Programming language design and implementation</li>
<li>System software</li>
<li>System architecture</li>
<li>Experience with system operations</li>
</ul>
<!-- included from include/aboutacsi2-en.html END -->

<p>
ACSI2016 will accept the following styles of submissions: regular papers (long/short), presentations of overseas publication, and posters.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>(1) Regular papers (long papers)</dt>
<dd> 
<p>
High quality papers (at most 10 pages) that establish significant
results and ideas are solicited in this category.  Papers must be
written in English.

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee for
sustaining the quality of presentations in the meeting, selection of
accepted papers and award selection. The program committee expects
that the review reports will help the author(s) submit the revised
papers to international conferences/journals in the near future.
Review reports will be sent to the author(s) in English or
Japanese. The author(s) may ask reviewers to write reports in English
at the submission.
</p>
<p>
The author(s) of each accepted paper must
register for the meeting to give an oral presentation, either in
English or in Japanese. 
Presentation slides should be written either in English or in Japanese, too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(2) Regular papers (short papers) </dt>
<dd>
<p>
High quality papers (4-6 pages) that establish significant results
and ideas are solicited in this category.  Papers must be written in
English.  All submitted papers will be reviewed as long papers. Papers
with promising results or those bringing fruitful discussion in the
meeting will be also accepted.
</p>
<p>
The author(s) of each accepted paper must
register for the meeting to give an oral presentation, either in
English or in Japanese. Presentation slides
should be written either in English or in Japanese, too.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>(3) Presentations of overseas publication</dt>
<dd><p> Presentations of high quality work that has been published in
(or accepted to) peer-reviewed international conferences or journals
but not in domestic ones are solicited in this category.
Acceptance/rejection of all submitted presentation proposals will be
judged by the program committee based on their relevance to ACSI and
the availability of presentation slots.  The original papers are used
only for the proposal selection process.
</p>
<p>
For each accepted proposal, the author(s) of the original paper must
register for the meeting to give an oral presentation, either in
English or in Japanese. Presentation slides should be written either
in English or in Japanese, too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(4) Posters</dt>
<dd><p> 
ACSI2016 will call for poster submissions, following
ACSI2015. <span class="del">The detailed submission information will be announced soon.</span>
The detailed submission information is available at <a href="./cfposters.en.html">"Call for Posters"</a>.

</p></dd>
</dl>


<h4> [Limited Access to Accepted Papers] </h4>

<p>
ACSI does not publish any proceedings. The papers accepted for ACSI
are not opened to the public. Copies of the accepted papers will be
distributed only to attendees of the ACSI2016, during the meeting
dates and one week after the meeting.
</p>

<h4> [Submission Regulations for Regular Papers] </h4>
<p>
The IEEE conference style (US letter or A4 size) should
be used for the regular papers submission. The page limit for long papers is 10
pages, and 6 pages for short papers. It must be an original work,
which has not appeared in and has not been accepted for other
peer-reviewed conferences or journals, domestic or international, of
all categories including regular papers, letters, and technical
notes. Papers that are included in or accepted for journals or conferences
but the publications (e.g. proceedings) are not assigned either ISBN or ISSN
number can be submitted.
</p>

<p>
The template of the IEEE conference style is available at
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>. Please submit a PDF file of your manuscript following this style. A submission not following the page limit and the style would be rejected.
</p>

<h4> [Award for Regular Papers] </h4> 

<p> ACSI2016 program committee selects at most one "ACSI2016 Outstanding
Research Award" in each track. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover,
ACSI2016 gives "ACSI2016 Outstanding Student Research Award" for the best paper
written by a student. To be qualified the student award, the first
author should be a student and she/he must present the work in the
meeting. A student working for a company is entitled to the award only when he/she has done the work as a student.
</p>

<p>
Above two awards are mainly selected from the view point of
quality of the research, its practicality and potential. Additionally,
the presentation quality is taken into account for the evaluation of
the paper. No paper may receive both awards.
</p>

<h4> [IPSJ Transactions on ACS: Special issue on ACSI] </h4>
<p>
There is a special issue on ACSI in the ACS transactions, which will
be announced about three weeks after the notification of ACSI review
results. ACSI program committee cooperates with ACS editors to aim
quicker review response than the regular issue of ACS. Please note,
however, that the special issue is judged according to the criterion
of ACS transactions, which is not identical to that for ACSI.
</p>

<h4> [Submissions] </h4>
<p> All papers should be submitted through EasyChair.  The opening of
the submission site is to be announced in ACSI2016 web page
(http://acsi.hpcc.jp/2016/). The author(s) is (are) requested to
choose one of the following three tracks that most closely matches the
submitted paper when submitting. Note that the author(s) may submit a
paper without choosing a track if it is difficult. In this case, the
program committee will determine a suitable track for the submitted
paper. In addition, even though the author(s) chose a track for the
submission, the program committee would move the paper to another
track when necessary.

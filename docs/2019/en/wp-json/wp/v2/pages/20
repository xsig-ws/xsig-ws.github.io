It solicits contributions from a wide range of fields related to computing systems,  infrastructures, and programming, spanning all areas covered by the sponsoring special interest groups.<\/p>\n<p>The main objectives of xSIG are to provide a forum to present and discuss research ideas among researchers spanning many fields and to raise young  researchers through a globally standard peer review process.  In particular,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we hope authors of xSIG workshop to advance their research based on feedback received and step up to submitting their work to international  conferences and journals.\n<li>we hope to give authors substantial feedback as well as a place for young researchers to practice\/improve writing papers for review, through the  globally standard conference format of submitting papers for review, receiving\/writing reviews, discussing papers in the program committee meeting, etc.\n<\/ul>\n<p>To this end, xSIG features the following five ideas.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>We do not publish workshop proceedings<\/em>, so that the work presented in xSIG will not be regarded as published; papers presented in xSIG  will be available to the audience during the workshop.\n<li>We accommodate many presentations by young researchers including students in the <em>Young researcher presentation slots<\/em>.<br \/>\n<em>We particularly encourage students working on their Master\/Bachelor&#8217;s theses to submit a paper around them<\/em>.<br \/>\nWe award many students from diverse criteria.<\/p>\n<li>We establish <em>Young Program Committee Member<\/em> alongside the regular Program Committee and welcomes participation of young researchers including students to  it, for &ldquo;an early exposure&rdquo; of motivated students to peer review work normally done by senior researchers.\n<li>We make the participation to the workshop <em>free for students<\/em>.\n<li>We seek and try new ideas that change or broaden the formats in which researchers&#8217; efforts are appreciated and exchanged, in addition to the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of reviewing papers.\n<\/ol>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"..\/cfp\/\">CFP<\/a> for more details.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>about xSIG xSIG (cross-disciplinary workshop on computing Systems, Infrastructures, and programminG) is a work <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/about.html\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=20"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":529,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/20\/revisions\/529"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2019\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=20"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

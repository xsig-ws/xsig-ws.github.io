Its performance has become equal to or better than that of human&#8217;s on several tasks including image classification and on speech<br \/>\nrecognition. On the other hand, the computational costs for its development and implementation has become larger, which make it difficult to apply it to larger-scale tasks such as video recognition. To solve this problem, it is important to develop computer systems specified for deep learning. This talk will introduce our co-design approach for fast and cost-effective deep learning algorithm platform. In this project, researchers from machine learning and from high performance computing corporate to optimize algorithms and architectures simultaneously.\n<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<h3><a name=\"iva\"><\/a>Tutorial A (May 28th, 10:00-)<\/h3>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;width: 20%;margin: 0px 0px 2ex 1em\" src=\"http:\/\/xsig.hpcc.jp\/2019\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2019\/04\/msyksphinz_logo.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Speaker<\/dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http:\/\/msyksphinz.hatenablog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">msyksphinz<\/a> (Handle name) (FPGA Development Diary Author)<\/dd>\n<dt>Title<\/dt>\n<dd>Changing semiconductor world around open-source CPU architecture &#8220;RISC-V&#8221;<\/dd>\n<dt>Abstract<\/dt>\n<dd style=\"text-align: justify\">RISC-V has been attracted as an open source CPU architecture. RISC-V foundation are getting attension by attending many companies. Semiconductor industry, which had tended to close in the past, is following the open architecture by RISC-V. And, many semiconductor vendors that have had a closed policy changed their policy, and they started to open their IPs. While explaining the latest trends in open hardware and its ecosystem centered on RISC-V, I will introduce how the semiconductor development industry is changing.\n<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<h3><a name=\"ivb\"><\/a>Tutorial B (May 29th, 10:00-)<\/h3>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;width: 20%;margin: 0px 0px 2ex 1em\" src=\"http:\/\/xsig.hpcc.jp\/2019\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2019\/04\/imai_self_portrait_real.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Speaker<\/dt>\n<dd><!-- a href=\"WANT URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u3000-->Takeo Imai (Idein inc. \/ National Institute of Informatics)<\/dd>\n<dt>Title<\/dt>\n<dd>Basics of deep learning compilers and their recent trends<\/dd>\n<dt>Abstract<\/dt>\n<dd style=\"text-align: justify\">According to the widespread use of deep learning in recent years, deep learning compilers that optimize a deep neural network (or DNN) and generate executable code that runs on various hardware began to be used.

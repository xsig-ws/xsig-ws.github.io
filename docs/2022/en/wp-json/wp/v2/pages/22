However, there was growing concern about its future at <a href=\"http:\/\/acsi.hpcc.jp\/2016\/\">ACSI 2016<\/a>. Therefore, we established <a href=\"http:\/\/kangaeru.github.io\/kangaeru\/\">\u201cThinking Committee\u201d<\/a> to have community-wide discussion without any preconditions attached, and had held a series of discussions through four off-line meetings from Feb. to July, 2017. As a consequence, we had reconfirmed the following points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important that to have a community-wide symposium (workshop) in addition to the activities of each SIG for interaction among the researchers especially in our field of computing systems.<\/li>\n<li>Reviewing submitted papers helps to promote the development of researches and to foster young researchers.<\/li>\n<li>A domestic symposium (workshop) should be regarded as an early stage of researches. Therefore,\n<ul>\n<li>Submission to this symposium (workshop) should not be an obstacle for later submission to international conferences\/journals; that is, the risk that work presented in this symposium (workshop) is regarded as published should be lowered;<\/li>\n<li>In order for this symposium (workshop) to be positioned in an early stage of research, it is not effective to restrict the language to English.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>We should place emphasis on the role of a symposium (workshop) to foster young researchers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/\">The basic idea of xSIG<\/a> is discussed in this \u201cThinking Committee\u201d.

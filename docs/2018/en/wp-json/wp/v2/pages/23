Moreover, <em>we purpose the progression of the researches and fostering young researchers through the reviewing process<\/em>.  We expect the reviewers to give not only the evaluation of the paper but also constructive comment to advance the research.  We expect the author(s) to advance the research, and submit revised papers to international conferences\/journals in the near future.   <\/p>\n<p>To this end, we evaluate submitted papers from the view point not only of the quality of the paper but also of <em>the potential of the research<\/em>.  The presentation quality is taken into account for the evaluation. <\/p>\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"dup\/\">this page<\/a> for the rules for duplicate submission.<\/p>\n<h3>Young Researcher Presentation Slots<\/h3>\n<p>The author(s) of each accepted paper must register for the workshop to give an oral presentation.  The presentation must be in English or Japanese. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to the regular sessions, xSIG provides <em>young researcher presentation slots<\/em> for young researchers including students.  Even if a paper is not accepted for the regular session, if the first author is B4, M1, or M2 student (at submission time), there still remains a second chance of an oral presentation in the young researcher slots.  <em>xSIG provides many young researcher slots by adjusting time for each presentation<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend the first author of a paper accepted for a young researcher slot to give a presentation again in the poster session.  We expect deeper discussion in the poster session based on the oral presentation in the young researcher slot.<\/p>\n<p>We will also call for poster submissions.  The detailed submission information will be announced soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Submission Regulations<\/h3>\n<p>Papers must be written in English or <a href=\"\/2018\/cf\/cfp\/\">Japanese<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The restriction on the submitted paper is relaxed utilizing the feature that xSIG does not publish proceedings.  <em>The paper format is not restricted<\/em>.  Not the number of pages but the number of words is limited.  This would be 5 to 10 pages in 10pt, twocolumn style.  Please read <a href=\"format\/\">this page<\/a> for more details.<\/p>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https:\/\/easychair.org\/conferences\/?conf=xsig2017\" target=\"_blank\">EasyChair<\/a> for the process of submission and review.  Please see <a href=\"guide\/\">Submission Guide<\/a> for more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Awards<\/h3>\n<h4>Award Categories<\/h4>\n<dl>\n<dt>Research Awards<\/dt>\n<dd>We select one <em>Best Research Award<\/em>, and about three <em>Outstanding Research Awards<\/em>.<\/dd>\n<dt>Student Awards<\/dt>\n<dd>We also selects one <em>Best { B4 | M1 | M2 } Student Award<\/em>\uff0cand about three <em>Outstanding { B4 | M1 | M2 } Student Awards<\/em> from the papers of which the first authors are { B4 | M1 | M2 } students.<\/dd>\n<dt>Student Awards for Criteria<\/dt>\n<dd>We select <em>Outstanding { Originality | Significance | Presentation | Effort | English } Awards<\/em> from the papers of which the first authors are students.  Outstanding Effort Award recognizes time and effort for implementation, data acquisition, and so on.<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<h4>Restrictions<\/h4>\n<p>No paper may receive multiples awards.<\/p>\n<p>We do not give these awards to the core members, i.e., <a href=\"\/2018\/en\/org\/oc-pc\/\">the organizing chair, the program chair, the program vice chairs, and the program secretary<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Young PC members<\/h3>\n<p>It is beneficial for young researchers to have experience of a PC member for their research and writing activity.<br \/>\nWe invite young researchers including students as <a \/>Young PC members<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A student who have had his\/her submitted papers reviewed can be a young PC member.<\/p>\n<p>A submitted paper is assigned at most one young PC member along with regular PC members.  A young PC member reviews the assigned paper, and participates in the discussion at the PC meeting.  The regular PC members assigned to the paper and the PC are responsible for the final decision of paper acceptance.<\/p>\n<h3>IPSJ Transactions on ACS: Special Issue on xSIG<\/h3>\n<p>We will have a special issue on xSIG in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acs.hpcc.jp\/welcome-e.html\">IPSJ transactions of Advanced Computing Systems (ACS)<\/a>.  ACS will call for papers in three weeks after the author notification of xSIG (Mar. 21, 2018); the deadlines of registration and paper upload is Apr. 9 and 16, respectively.  <\/p>\n<p>The PC of xSIG cooperates with ACS editors for <em>quicker and more consistent review<\/em>.  However, please note that submitted papers to ACS will be reviewed according to the criterion of ACS transactions which is not identical to that of xSIG.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scope and Review Criteria xSIG solicits contributions from a wide range of fields related to computing systems <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/cf\/cfp.html\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":17,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/23"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=23"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/23\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/17"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/xsig.ipsj.or.jp\/2018\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=23"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
